      "Opening: “Welcome to your yin practice. Today, we will be opening the hips—an area where we tend to store stress, tension, and unspoken emotion. As you settle in, bring your awareness to your breath. Let each inhale nourish you, and each exhale soften and release. You are safe here. Supported. Ready to receive.",
      "Pose 1: Butterfly, 5 minutes",
      "Bring the soles of your feet together and let your knees fall wide. If you are reclined, support the knees with blocks or cushions. This pose gently opens the inner hips. Soften the eyes. Relax your jaw. Let your breath find its own rhythm.",
      "🛠 Modify: Sit on a folded blanket or recline with support under knees.",
      "Pose 2: Half Butterfly, 3 minuets each side",
      "Extend your right leg and bring the sole of your left foot to the inner right thigh. Fold over the extended leg. No forcing. Just a gentle yielding. Let the spine round.",
      "➡️ Switch sides",
      "Pose 3: Double Pigeon, 4 minutes each side",
      "Stack your shins, right leg in front, ankle over knee. If this is too intense, sit cross-legged. This targets the outer hip and glute. Find your edge and breathe into it. Imagine melting over the earth, let gravity do the work.",
      "🛠 Modify: Use props under knees or sit on a block.",
      "➡️ Switch sides",
      "Pose 4: Sleeping Swan, 4 minutes each side",
      "Slide your right knee forward, shin angled toward the front of your mat. Extend the left leg behind. Use a bolster or blanket under the hip if needed. Then fold forward. Surrender the upper body.",
      "➡️ Switch sides",
      "Pose 5: Dragon Pose, 3 minutes each side",
      "Step your right foot forward into a low lunge. Let your hips sink forward. Keep your hands on blocks if needed. Feel into the hip flexor and the front of the left hip.",
      "➡️ Switch sides",
      "Pose 6: FrogPose, 5 minutes",
      "Come to hands and knees. Gently widen your knees apart and bring the inner edges of your feet to the mat. Sink your hips back. If this is too intense, take a wide-legged childs pose instead. This is a deep one. If emotions arise, greet them like old friends. You are just witnessing.",
      "🛠Modify: Use blankets under knees. Option to lie on bolster.",
      "Pose 7: Reclined Twist, 3 minutes each side",
      "“Lie on your back. Hug your knees in and let them fall to the right. Open your left arm and gaze to the left. Allow the hips to ring out the residue.",
      "➡️ Switch sides",
      "Pose 8: Happy Baby, 3 minutes",
      "Hold the outer edges of your feet or shins. Let your knees move toward your armpits. Gently rock if it feels good.",
      "Pose 9: Savasana, 7-10 minutes",
      "Settle into your final rest. Allow the hips to integrate all the deep opening and release. There is nothing left to do, nowhere to be. Just this moment.  Feel the floor rise up to hold you. Let yourself dissolve.",
      "🛠Modify: Place bolster under knees or use an eye pillow.",
      "Closing: “Begin to bring gentle movement back. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Draw your knees in and roll to one side. Come up slowly.Bring your hands to heart center. Bow to your own courage for showing up and going deep. May the space you have created ripple out into your day.",

    closing: "Let each breath ground you. Feel supported by the earth."
