      <p className={styles.description}>Yin Yoga is a slow, meditative style of yoga that targets the deep connective tissues of the body ‚Äî fascia, ligaments, joints ‚Äî rather than the superficial muscles. It is known for long, passive holds and mindful stillness. </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>The Purpose of Yin Yoga:</p>
      <p className={styles.description}>1.	Stretch and hydrate connective tissue. Holding poses for time puts gentle, sustained stress on fascia and joints to promote elasticity and hydration.</p>
      <p className={styles.description}>2.	Increase joint mobility and flexibility. Especially in the hips, pelvis, spine, and lower back ‚Äî places where tightness often limits movement.</p>
      <p className={styles.description}>3.	Calm the nervous system. Yin activates the parasympathetic ‚Äúrest and digest‚Äù state through slow breathing and minimal movement.</p>
      <p className={styles.description}>4.	Cultivate mindfulness and inner awareness. With fewer poses and longer holds, students have time to turn inward and observe physical or emotional sensations.</p>
